### How This Works:
1. **Profile Views and Followers:** These badges track your profile activity, such as views, followers, and repository stars.
2. **Technologies Section:** A code block showcases your skills in frontend, backend, databases, and tools.
3. **GitHub Stats:** The two widgets (GitHub Stats and Top Languages) dynamically show your contribution data and the most used programming languages from your repositories.

To see the stats working, you need to enable these widgets in your repository. For the stats, you can get them from [GitHub Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).

Let me know if you want to customize anything further!
